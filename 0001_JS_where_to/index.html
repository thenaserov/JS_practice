<!-- YOU CAN PUT <SCRIPT> IN BOTH HEADER AND BODY -->
<!-- YOU CAN ALSO PUT IT IN A FILE AND CONNECT THEM AGAIN IN BOTH HEAD AND BODY -->
<!--
    ADVANTAGE OF EXTERNAL JS CODE

    It separates HTML and code
    It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
    Cached JavaScript files can speed up page loads

    HOW TO CONNECT THEM

    With a full URL (a full web address)
    With a file path (like /js/)
    Without any path
